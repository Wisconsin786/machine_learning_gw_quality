I like to use R notebooks to keep a quick log of activities. You can see an example of a live notebook I've working on [here](https://github.com/richpauloo/kings-river-fan-tprogs/blob/master/documentation/README.Rmd). Keeping a joint research log is great for:  

* Aesthetics:  
    + markdown syntax, which we're familiar with  
    + easily renders into a nice PDF, and visible on github  
    
* Reproducibility:  
    + again, it's nice for people wondering how we spent our time  
  
* Staying Focused:  
    + writing down everything helps us quickly diagnose problems arise because we have a record of activities  
    
  
We can delete this once we're on the same page, and start using it when we work on this down the line.
